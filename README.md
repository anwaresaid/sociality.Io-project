## one page project
this project the only tab that's working is publish => feed which shows the card which data was imported from JSON file.
tried to imitate the design of the sketch, some data is static since there was no data included in data.json related to these data.
example of the static data:
likes, comments, views, retweets, shares, notification number.

## company logo tab
for the company logo tab, I was not sure where I should get the logos from, so i made assumption that it's from account=> image, but most of them dont work because it's not a url.
so I display empty image if the account => image is not working. you can choose whichever company you want, the chosen company will be highlighted with white.
no futher actions related to the companies after clicking as it was not mentioned in the project scope.

## navbar tabs
clicking on navbar tabs will navigate to the page, all the pages dont exist except the feed under publish tab.
if the navbar has a child, add the child to sideBarElements.js and a plus sign will be added dynamicall and once clicked the children will show.
